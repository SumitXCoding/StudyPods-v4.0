## About StudyPods v4.0

Study pods is an initiative taken by DSC MBM to promote peer-to-peer learning among the students with a notion that says ‚ÄúLearn Together, Build Together‚Äù.The program is designed to offer participants a good exposure of technology and the technical world. It is an approx one month-long program that connects like-minded participants interested in a particular domain to come together, learn together and then build together. StudyPod mentors assist participants with the roadmap, resources, take weekly updates and solve doubts which cannot be solved by the team members. At the end of the program each StudyPod needs to submit a project or a propsal for a paper that showcases their learnings during the program.

## Weekly Logs

Weekly Logs is an important activity planned by our team to motivate us to note their progress and prepare the log for future generation to plan accordingly.
### Week-1: Basic Python<br>
=> Learned Python from scratch.<br> 
=> Practised problems on Codewars daily <br>
=> Practised various problems on Hackerrank<br>
=> Learned Python from books For ex. Python crash course<br>
### Week-2: AI/ML<br>
=>We started with learning different algorithm like Linear regression ,KNN etc. <br>
=> Learned about Generative AI, LLM and NLP <br>
=> We learned about Transformers and API's<br>
### Week-3: Advance AI and Project Discussion 
=> We started with planning our Project  <br>
=> Got to know how to API works and more specify about Youtube API<br>
=> Studied about Data CLeaning and Analysis <br>
### Week-4: Project
=> studied about how to get transcription using Transformers  <br>
=> learned about how prediction happens and applied them<br>
=> appplied prediction and completed Summerization <br>


<h1> YouTube Video Summerizer </h1> <br>
 
<h2> Why YouTube Summerizer </h2>
For many videos, the main content of the videos is only 50-60% of the total length.Youtube summarizer will summarize the content of the video by keeping all the important points and making it short and easily understandable. Summarizing transcripts of such videos automatically allows us to quickly look out for the important patterns in the video and helps us to save time and efforts to go through the whole content of the video.

<h2> Project Features </h2>
1. Video Transcript Extraction : Automatically extracts transcripts from YouTube videos using the video URL.<br>
2. Transcription : Accessing the textual content of YouTube videos using YouTube Transcript API <br>
3. Summerization : We are using extractive summarization using SpaCy. Other techniques like TextRank, which is also available in SpaCy, or neural network-based models like BERT, GPT or summarization algorithms including Gensim, NLTK and TF-IDF can be used for more advanced summarization task. <br>

<h2> Installations </h2>
<ul>
<li>!pip install -q transformers</li> </b2> 
<li>!pip install -q youtube_transcript_api</li> </b2>
<li>pip install youtube-transcript-api</li> </b2>
<li>pip install -U spacy</li> </b2>
</ul>

<h2> Example Videos that can be used for Transcript </h2>
 youtube_video = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p0o5cmgLdE </br>
 youtube_video ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrEkYscgbqE&t=1s </br>
 Any youtube video can be used. (the video should be strictly in English only irrsepective of length).<br>

 <h1>Future Upgradation</h1>

<h5> we will be working on following features to upgrade this project </h5>
<ul>

<li><b>Language Translation</b>: Translating summaries into various languages. </br></li>
<li><b>Text-to-Speech</b>: Converting summaries into audio format, making the content more accessible. </br></li>
<li><b>Customizable Summary Length</b>: Allows users to select the desired summary length. </br></li>
<li><b>Interactive Web-application</b>: We are working on both backend and frontend development using Streamlit. The application will provide an easy-to-use interface for all functionalities.  </br>
