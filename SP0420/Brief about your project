we have created a project in frontend stream. 
<br>
Our project is related to Anime and Cartoon News and Blogs. It is a one-stop place to get updated about the latest anime and cartoons.
<br>
We have webpages with interactive and responsive layout. We have also used Java-Script in some parts.
<br>
Some interesting features of our website include: multiple webpages, animations on scroll, fully functional contact-us form, about-us page, login and signup pages, etc.
<br>
Over the past one month we, team members, with the help of our mentor, aquired skills in web-develpoment, learned how to work in team, using git and github.
